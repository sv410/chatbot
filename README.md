# NLP Chatbot with SQL Backend

This repository contains code for a chatbot implemented using natural language processing (NLP) techniques without relying on an API. The chatbot interacts with users through text input, understands their queries using NLP, and retrieves relevant information from a SQL database backend.

## Features

- **NLP-based Interaction**: The chatbot utilizes natural language processing to understand user queries and respond accordingly.
- **SQL Database Backend**: Data storage and retrieval are managed using a SQL database, allowing for efficient data management and retrieval.
- **Customizable Responses**: Responses provided by the chatbot can be customized based on the specific use case and requirements.
- **Scalability**: The use of SQL backend facilitates scalability, allowing the chatbot to handle a large volume of queries and maintain data integrity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: nltk, scikit-learn, pandas, sqlite3 (for SQLite database), or any other suitable SQL library for your chosen database system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-chatbot-sql.git
    cd nlp-chatbot-sql
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your SQL database and configure the connection details in the code.

## Usage

1. Ensure that your SQL database is set up and accessible.
2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

3. Interact with the chatbot by providing text inputs and observing the responses.

## Customization

- Modify the NLP components or add additional preprocessing steps to enhance the chatbot's understanding of user queries.
- Customize the SQL database schema and queries to suit your specific data storage and retrieval requirements.
- Implement additional features or functionalities as needed for your use case.
